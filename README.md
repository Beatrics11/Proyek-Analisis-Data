# Proyek-Analisis-Data
The data analysis process includes Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation. The analysis process is carried out using Jupyter Notebook while the dashboard is built using streamlit. The dataset used is Bikesharing which is taken from the Kaggle website.

To run the dashboard there are some things you should make sure before

1. Download the zip file, then extract that in your directory
2. Make sure you have installed python on your computer and that is the new version one, you can check it by using command prompt like
```
python --version
```
3. You also need to makesure that you have any IDE or something like that, I use Visual Studio Code
4. Make sure that you have installed the pip, because you will need that for install any library or packages. You can install that by download from browser or just do it from your command prompt like thi
```
python get-pip.py
```
5. If the pip have installed, now you have to install any library that will be use in the dashboard. You can look any required library on dashboard.py (on the top section) or just see in requirement.txt. This is an example to download the libraries using command prompt (preferable in your dashboard directory)
```
pip install pandas
```
6. Go to your dashboard directory (folder) then open terminal from there
7. Now, you will open your dashboard in your local server, on your terminal use this command
```
streamlit run dashboard.py
```
8. Your dashboard will open in your browser, just check it and make sure it run smoothly
